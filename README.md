i.md extension comes from a word: markdown. It's a markup language for text formatting. Maybe at first it isn't be obvious but markup has been created to make text creation easier. In HTML language, the most important heading goes with h1 tag. Similarily, we will have # before a heading in our document.

We edit .md files in any text or code editor (Notepad, Sublime, Atom, CS, etc.). 

You'll find out more on markdown usage on GitHub, and on dillinger.io you'll find an editor with a preview.
